# timtcana

The code powering a weather station in my apartment.

Uses Rust for the API and Python for collecting data (until [#1](https://github.com/Xe/timtcana/issues/1)
is fixed). Currently depends on the following things:

- [Adafruit_Python_DHT](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
- [DHT11 sensors](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht)

Full build and setup instructions will be posted on my blog (TODO(Xe): add link here).
